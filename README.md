# What is this?

- The plan is to make this a competitive programming cheat-sheet / book full of patterns and things so that one is able to use this in a contest
    - the goal is that you donâ€™t need to use the internet for this
    - not only will this have algorithms, but cool patterns and stuff one finds in the way as well.

# How to collaborate to it?

- Some topics have a given structure, if so follow it.
- If itâ€™s an algorithm or data structure (these are for the most part black-boxable), follow the following structure
    - Quick explanation of how it works (nothing too in-depth)
    - Implementation, with clean code and comments around how it works and how to modify
    - applications (so patterns and variations of it, explained)
- If it is a mathematical topic follow the following structures
    - mathematical definition
    - mathematical properties
    - useful theorems, patterns and so forth
- If itâ€™s a concise and simple topic, just paste its implementation

# Other things
- If itâ€™s just way too obvious donâ€™t add it, letâ€™s be as space-efficient as possible
# Como configurar (template):
(en mac)
1. En la parte de arriba, click code -> preferences -> configure user snippets -> elige cpp.json
2. una vez en el cpp.json, pega template.json entero
3. rompe con el template ğŸ˜ˆ
